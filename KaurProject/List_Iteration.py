#  -- List Iteration:
# ****************************************/

# a=[10,12,13,14]  this is a list
# for i in a  # this means i will have values from list a
# for i in range(len(a)) # this means i will have index from list a as we have used a length variable.
# for i in range(1,5) # this means i will have index value as we have given a range between 1 and 5.


# 1. Iteration using for loop
a=["Hulk","Thor","Ironman","Captain America"]
# for i in a:
#     print(i)

# 2 .Iteration using for loop with Range and length function

# i means Index( address of values)
# a is a list that has values

# for i in range(len(a)):
#     print(i)  # this will only display 1 to 4  Index numbers
#     print(a[i]) # this displays value at each index.

# 3. Iteration using While loop
# i=0
# while i< len(a):  # here i should be smaller than length of the list
#     print(a[i])
#     i=i+1

# 4. Using short- hand for loop.
#[print(i) for i in a]
